Android OS has opened up possibilities of working with NFC with their new API and support for NFC technology. Since it is a relatively new technology and its implementation is even newer, more is to be expected from NFC field as its popularity is grows exponentially. So creating an application in Android using the NFC technology seems to be the perfect way to show its magnanimous utility. This application is focused in providing services in areas like ID Authentication, Social Data Exchange, Ticketing/Coupon service and Product Cataloging using an NFC enabled mobile device and NFC tags. The application works in conjunction with NFC tags to read/write information from/to the tags. The Android Gingerbread SDK has NFC APIs which provides such read/write functionality. Using it, we expect that this application will provide a unified experience across many NFC applications. We aim to provide a one stop application which can be used for multiple purposes.
